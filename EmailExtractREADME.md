# businesstools/EmailExtract

Hi this script is for extracting all the emails and assocaited names from the Outlook 2016 sent emails export CSV. 
Also parses through orgnaization emails and deletes them
It should work with any outlook inbox export csv.

To run just specificy the file path and the name you want the export to have and the file will export to 
the same directory as the original file.
